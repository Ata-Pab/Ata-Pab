I have a strong passion for software development. Over the years, I've gained hands-on experience in **embedded software development**, real-time control algorithms, and hardware integration. I enjoy expanding my work beyond embedded systems by developing **desktop** and **web applications** to increase efficiency in the projects I work on. I also have a strong background in **machine learning** and **computer vision**, both from my undergraduate and graduate studies. I believe that working in diverse fields gives me a versatile perspective, allows me to quickly develop solutions to problems and create successful architectures. I am deeply motivated to design reliable and well-structured software and to continuously improve as a developer through new technologies and challenging projects.
